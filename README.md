# JokeAPI Project

Welcome to the **JokeAPI Project** — a fun and interactive web application that fetches and displays jokes from the [JokeAPI](https://v2.jokeapi.dev/). Built using **Node.js**, **Express**, **Axios**, and **EJS**, this app lets users choose joke categories and personalize jokes by replacing “Chuck Norris” with their own name. Perfect for developers learning API integration, server-side rendering, and responsive UI design.
